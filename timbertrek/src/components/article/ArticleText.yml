          Once you have found decision trees that meet your needs, you can click
          the heart button on the top right of the <em>Tree Window</em> to
          bookmark them. You can see all bookmarked trees in the <em>Favorite
          Panel</em>. You can also click the comment button on the <em>Tree
          Window</em> to add a short comment to document why you choose this
          decision tree. Alternatively, you can add or edit comments in the
          <em>Favorite Panel</em> directly. Once you are satisfied with your
          decision tree curation, you can click the download button to save all
          bookmarked trees with your comments. You can load these trees with
          TimberTrek's Python package. Your comments can also help you continue
          curating in the future.

        Users can use the <em>Favorite Panel</em> to keep track of all
        bookmarked decision trees. This panel shows a thumbnail of each tree
        along with a user-entered comment. The comment can document the model
        curation motivation and context. Once satisfied with their curation, a
        user can click the save button to download all bookmarked trees with
        their documentation. It helps users deploy satisfactory models or
        continue curation in the future.

development: >
  TimberTrek is written in <a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org'
  target='_blank'>TypeScript</a> using <a href='https://svelte.dev'
  target='_blank'>Svelte</a> as a framework and <a href='https://d3js.org'
  target='_blank'>D3.js</a> for visualizations. The source code is available on
  <a href='https://github.com/poloclub/timbertrek' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.
  The entire app runs locally and privately in your web browser, and your model
  and data would never leave your machine. Anyone can easily access TimberTrek
  on their desktop or tablets, without the need of setting up dedicated servers or
  writing code. With a flexible design, TimberTrek supports all types of
  computational notebooks, such as Jupyter Notebook & Lab, Google Colab, and VS
  Code Notebook. With the cross-platform support, we hope TimberTrek will fit into
  your favorite ML development workflow.
